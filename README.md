# VLSM_calculator

## Usage
This program is made to help me at school with computer networks. It can compute, subnets IP addresses, masks and prefixes. 
If you need subnets which are same sizes, just enter number of subnets, that are equal to power of two, however if you need specific sizes of networks, enter the number of them and number for the each host (They need to be entered in descending order).
